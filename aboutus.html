                                    Hi! I’m Melanie and I’m a sophomore in the visual arts academy. I joined iGEM to collaborate with people from other academies on an innovative research project. Outside of iGEM, I like watching movies and spending time with my friends and family.

                                    Hi. I’m Tate and I’m a sophomore in the Culinary Academy at BCA. I joined iGEM because I thought synthetic biology was an interesting field, and I thought doing a research project with a team would be a fulfilling and fun experience. Some of my hobbies include playing tennis, baking treats, playing video games, and listening to music.
