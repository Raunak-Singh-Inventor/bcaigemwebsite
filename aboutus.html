                                        I thought it would be a fun and
                                        interesting experience that applies
                                        engineering concepts to a project that
                                        reaches natural sciences. Outside of
                                        iGEM, I do debate and play the bass
                                        clarinet.

                                        iGEM to explore synthetic biology. I
                                        also have a lot of other interest
                                        including designing, programming, and

                                        in the class of 2025! I joined iGEM to
                                        be part of a fun and social community
                                        that creates amazing projects that can
                                        help people and I fell in love with the
                                        genetic aspect of the team! Other than
                                        iGEM, I'm also on the volleyball team. I
                                        also love to play basketball and listen
                                        to music in my free time!

                                    in biology, I was drawn to iGEM in order to
                                    get a positive experience with research that
                                    was done collaboratively, as I would need
                                    this for my future career. Outside of iGEM,
                                    I enjoy working on my own mathematical
                                    projects and hanging out with friends.

                                    academy at BCA. I joined iGEM because of my
                                    passion for biology and to further my
                                    research experience. In my free time, I
                                    enjoy watching and playing basketball, and
                                    spending time with my friends and family.
